Title: An In-depth Report on Retrieval Augmented Generation and Its Advanced Applications

Introduction:
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely recognized pipeline that significantly enhances responses from large language models. By incorporating relevant data retrieved from a vector database as context to a prompt, RAG alleviates the inherent limitations posed by standalone language models and improves the quality and reliability of generated responses. This report offers a deep exploration into the mechanics of RAG operation, the role of an agentic model in decision making, and potential applications in diverse industries.

Main Body: 
RAG operates by retrieving relevant data from a vector database, which then provides the necessary context for the prompts being addressed by the large language model (LLM). This process allows for a more grounded and accurate response. Current use of RAG in most pipelines is limited to generating response once LLM has been called.

The advent of an agentic RAG pipeline, however, introduces a new degree of versatility to this process. It capitalizes on the language understanding capabilities of the LLM to effectively decide which vector database to query when multiple databases exist, or how to frame the response with requirements like generating text, charts, or code snippets depending on the query context.

Innovatively, databases could consist of varied data sources like internal documentation containing policies and guidelines, or a general knowledge base featuring industry standards and public resources. With the agent's power, it can intelligently decide which of these data reservoirs would provide the most relevant answer to a query, based on its understanding of the content and context of the question.

In situations where a question doesn't align with the information available in the vector databases, the agent can resort to a failsafe mechanism which communicates inability to provide the requested information. This not only enhances the system's reliability but also its adaptability.

Conclusion:
Integrating an active decision-making agent within the RAG pipeline has significant implications for customer support systems, legal tech, healthcare, among other fields. This evolution in RAG operation ushers in intelligent decision-making processes and a broader range of applications where the best data sources can be chosen and even real-time or third-party data can be incorporated.

As this technology continues to evolve, AI systems will reach new levels of contextual understanding, bringing tremendous value addition for end users. Thus, advanced RAG systems, by becoming more responsive, accurate, and adaptable, reveal unlimited potential in revolutionizing accuracy and efficiency across several fields.
